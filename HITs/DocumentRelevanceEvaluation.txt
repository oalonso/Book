is relevant if it would be useful if you were writing a report on the space 
program topic. Each document should be judged on its own merits. That is, a 
document is still relevant even if it is the thirtieth document you have 
seen with the same information.

Tips
- Payment based on quality of the work completed. Please follow the 
  instructions.
- Be consistent in your judgments.
