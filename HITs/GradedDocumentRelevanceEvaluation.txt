Document Relevance Evaluation

Instructions

Evaluate the relevance of a document to the given topic. A document is 
relevant if it would be useful if you were writing a report on such topic. 
Each document should be judged on its own merits. That is, a document 
is still relevant even if it is the thirtieth document you have seen with 
the same information.

Tips

- Payment is based on quality of the work completed. Please follow the 
  instructions.
- Be consistent in your judgments.
- A document should not be judged as relevant or irrelevant based only 
  on the title of the document. You must read the document.
